# sequence 

Definition:

Geometric progression : ar^n

Arithmetic progression:  b, b+d, b+2d, b+3d,  …, b+nd

Strings:

A string is a finite sequence, often denoted a1a2...an
▪ The length of the string is the number of its terms.
▪ The empty string, denoted λ, is the string that has no terms. 
					
Summation :

▪ Consider the sequence {an}.

We define the following summation:					
  n j=m					
  
▪ Terminology:

  j is called the index of summation,

  m is the lower limit, 

  n is the upper limit. 
  
(6) summation of geometric  progression:
			
  Consider the arithmetic progression, for reals a and d: a, ar, ar2 ar3, ..., arn, ... 𝑛
					
  ◼ What is the sum of the first n + 1 terms, ෍ 𝑎𝑟𝑗 ? 𝑗=0
					
  S = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^(n-1) + ar^n
					
  S–rS 		
  
	S = a(1-r^(n+1))/ (1-r)



(7)  useful summation:

  1+2+3+4+...+n :  k= (n+1)*n/2

  1^2+ 2^2+...+n^2 =  (n*(n+1)(2n+1))/6

  1^3 +2^3 + … + n^3 = n^2*(n+1)^2/4

  (等比数列）ar^k（sum) =  (ar^(n+1) -1)/(r-1)


(8) 	nested summation:	

To evaluate a nested summation, work from the inside out.					

▪ Example: first expand the inner summation and then compute the outer summation (like double integrals).

# cardinality 

(1)Cantor extended the Correspondence Principle to the infinite sets.

▪ Two sets A and B are defined to have the same cardinality (size) iff there is a bijection between them.

▪ A set is said to be countably infinite if it has the same size as N, the set of natural numbers.

▪ I.e., a set A is countably infinite iff there is a bijection (one-to-one and onto function) from N to A.

(2)A set is countable if it is finite or countably infinite. 

(3) so far, N, E, Z,  Q are countable.

(4) R IS

(5) 	
▪ The union of two countable sets is countable.
					
▪ A subset of a countable set is countable. ▪ If A is uncountable and A B then B is
					
uncountable.
